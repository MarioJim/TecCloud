## Installation

Run `yarn` in both `teccloud-api` and `teccloud-server` to install the dependencies needed to run the API server and the frontend server respectively.

## Development

Run `yarn dev` in both folders to run both servers in development mode, meaning they will reload when making changes to their files.
Running `yarn start` (in both folders) will run the projects in production mode.
